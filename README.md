# 15112-final-project
For my 15112 final project, I will be working to make a ludo game. Basically up to 2 players will
be able to play with each player starting off with 4 identical characters. The objective of the
game is to have your characters circle around the ludo board and reach their base and you win.
But if another player lands on the same spot you are, then you have to start all over again. There
will be two game modes in my game. Multiplayer, this will be played across a server with users
and second will be with the computer for which I will use artificial intelligence.

Libraries will include: Pygame or Tkinter, Socket, Random, Math and an AI library. 

By the first milestone I will complete get the game running and make a start screen with options:
start game, quit game, controls, high score and load game.
 By the second milestone I will complete the AI and multiplayer part of it and add 1 and 2 player 
 option to the start menu screen. I will also add some other features like the in game options like play again,
 save game, selection of different characters, sound, and a few more.
